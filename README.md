# Awesome-Selfhosted-Wish-List
A list of Free Software network services and web applications that don't exist for selfhosting. This repository works along side Awesome-Selfhosted by creating a list of software that that doesn't exist yet. The purpose of this is to organize the community to help build software or work on deprecated software that many currently wish for.
