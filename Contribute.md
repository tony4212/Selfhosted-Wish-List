* First, consider whether or not the self hosted software would be beneficial to more than one person.

* When adding new ideas for software please make sure the software doesn't already exist (unless it is deprecated or abandoned). Use google and github to search for selfhosting software.

Note that if this software actually becomes a thing, realize that it may not be based off of the abandoned software.
