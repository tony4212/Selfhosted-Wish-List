# Information

The goal of this repository is to help grow the self-hosting community by increasing awareness and improving upon organization of the demands for nonexistent software.


# Contributing

Before You decide to contribute please keep in mind that this list can become quite complex if carless forks and issues are added.

* First, consider whether or not the self hosted software would be beneficial to more than one person.

* When adding new ideas for software please make sure the software doesn't already exist (unless it is deprecated or abandoned). Use google and GitHub to search for self-hosting software. If you are already working on building software, but it is still in the development stage, meaning not ready for general use, then feel free to add it with the link attached.

* When adding ideas, please make sure that the title and description of the idea is clear and concise. If there is similar software that is abandoned add the link to the description. Note that if this software actually becomes a thing, realize that it may not be based off of the abandoned software.

# FAQ

* What is archives ?

Archives is a .md dedicated towards depricated selfhost projects. The goal is to have the ease of searching through code that can give the community other ideas for future projects.
